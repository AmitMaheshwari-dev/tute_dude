Python practice for Module 2: Basic Python Concepts

## Assignment 1: Basic Python Concepts

This assignment contains two Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts.

### Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
**File:** `Assignment1/Task1.py`

**Description:**
This program performs basic mathematical operations on two user-provided numbers.

**Functionality:**
- Takes two numbers as input from the user
- Performs the following operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with zero-division error handling)
- Displays the results of each operation

**How to Run:**
```bash
python Assignment1/Task1.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

--- Mathematical Operations Results ---
Addition: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Subtraction: 10.0 - 5.0 = 5.0
Multiplication: 10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
Division: 10.0 / 5.0 = 2.0
```

### Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
**File:** `Assignment1/Task2.py`

**Description:**
This program creates a personalized greeting message using the user's name.

**Functionality:**
- Takes first name and last name as input
- Concatenates them into a full name
- Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name

**How to Run:**
```bash
python Assignment1/Task2.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe

Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```
